Macaroni and cheese. Peanut butter and jelly. Hide and seek. Cookies and milk.
Research and development. Crime and Punishment. Surf and sand. Fish and chips.
Cheeseburgers and fries. Mom and dad. Marriage and divorce. Weekdays and
weekends. The soccer field and Ben & Jerry's. Mom and another guy. Milk and
honey. Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Some things go together like peas in a pod. 

But when mentioning things that just go together, how could one fail to mention
[Owengamingboy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCxPYICbpS1M-WWv9RgVQNg/) and
YouTube? Who is Owengamingboy, you may ask (if you've
been living under a rock for the last few years)? Owengamingboy is the online
moniker for a modern Renaissance man, or rather, boy, skilled in Fortnite, music,
and Fortnite. Breaking onto the YouTube scene on July 23, 2016, the young man
has had a meteoric upswing in popularity in a short two years, boasting over 90
subscribers at the time of writing. A brief perusal of his portfolio reveals a
myriad of videos called *Fortnite 100 Subsriber suprise countdown*.

However, on April 2, 2019, Owengamingboy, never one to rest on his laurels,
released a track the depths of which may never be fully understood. Titled "We
did it Dumb Officiall music video", this magnum opus is at once a musical
masterpiece as well as a cutting social commentary. Thankfully, this stroke of
genius has not escaped the public eye, and already has 19 views. Any more, I
fear, and YouTube's view counter may break.

From the get-go, Owengamingboy wastes no time in subverting traditional music
video expectations, as he leads with an all-black intro screen, save for the
words "Untitled" stitched across the screen. In this era of commercialization,
logos, and branding, Owengamingboy throws all expectations for revenue
generation out the proverbial window, instead forcing the viewer to come to
terms with the lack of a label for his creation. The viewer, in turn, feels a
sense of unease, as he can no longer simply associate a complex musical product
into the narrow dimensions of a title. When examining the song, the viewer must
face it in its messy, raw entirety. 

Moving onto the song itself, Owengamingboy starts off with the question,

> Yo! What's two plus two times half?

Perhaps one of the best opening verses in the last century, this inquiry may
seem easy enough to answer, but is, in fact, undecidable, as the half could be
applied to the whole sum, or just the latter two. Both readings are equally
valid, and throughout the song Owengamingboy forces the audience to come to
terms with uncertainty as he does here.

Ostensibly a diss track pertaining to a certain "Alicia", the composition breaks
tradition with its unconventional structure, with Owengamingboy impressively
managing to not rhyme a single word. Instead, he opts for a more prosaic,
stream-of-consciousness type rap, allowing the listener to observe firsthand his
inner machinations. Moreover, Owengamingboy showcases a vulnerability and
rawness that not many other rappers are able to convey through their songs when
he admits,
> I know, I keep stopping, cuz it's ... ummm ... new to rapping.

Continuing on to the titular refrain, Owengamingboy declares,
> we did it duuumb! ... WEEEE DID IT DUUUUUMMMMBBB!

In a clear nod to recent vocal innovations
utilized by contemporaries Tyler, The Creator and Playboi Carti, Owengamingboy
also emotionally channels his feelings, voice cracks notwithstanding. All the
while, a simple piano riff plays in the back, contrasting nicely with
Owengamingboy's syncopated delivery.

The deconstructive nature of *We did it Dumb* lies in its weaving of many pop
elements which when taken singularly are unremarkable characteristics of popular
music, but in combination, form an absurdist rendition that would make even
Kafka proud. If nothing else, *We did it Dumb* establishes Owengamingboy as one
of the most promising voices of the new generation, and it behooves any
self-respecting hip-hop fan to keep an eye on this young prodigy.
