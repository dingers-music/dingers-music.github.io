Traditional hip hop fans might dismiss Lil Yachty’s
[*Minnesota*](https://youtu.be/FvpWJKRPadk) as cheap pop music, but the song
contains deeper meaning than its bubbly sound immediately suggests. Released
in early 2016, the song became a viral sensation, boosting Lil Yachty to the
forefront of popular hip hop, even earning him a spot in a [Sprite

In this exegesis, we will investigate how
*Minnesota* signals an end to the era of “hard” trap music and ushers in a
subgenre within trap that champions more positive themes.

The song represents modern trap, stripped back to display the bare minimum
instrumentally. Unlike most traditional trap music, *Minnesota* employs a
simplistic piano melody as its primary instrumental driver. Rather than
employing aggressive beats and vocals, the song is rather pleasant sounding
and melodious. Of course, *Minnesota* is not a complete departure from trap,
as it maintains a constant, high-tempo hi-hat throughout the song. Lil
Yachty’s vocals, enhanced by auto-tune, is harmonious and complements the
high-pitched piano notes well. The sonics of *Minnesota* are significant in
the context of trap music because the lighthearted nature of the song
directly parallels the entire genre’s shift away from melancholy and
dangerous themes, and with this shift comes the observation that modern
instrumentals are not as gritty or aggressive as before.

Lyrically, *Minnesota* gives off the impression of being incredibly simplistic.
The chorus of *Minnesota*, admittedly repetitive, is in reality
rather bold considering who Yachty's predecessors are[^history]
because Lil Yachty openly challenges the glorification of drug dealing and gun
slinging. Addressing the reader directly, Lil Yachty sings

> You need to stay up out them streets if you can’t take the heat  
> ‘Cause it get cold like Minnesota.

The contrast between the “heat” of the streets and the “cold” of Minnesota
invokes a sense of discomfort as two extremes of temperature are presented as
results of being in the streets. Additionally, the word “heat” could be a
reference to firearms, as in the phrase “packing heat,”[^heat]
which is, again, a
reminder of how dangerous street life can potentially be.

In his first verse, Lil Yachty references issues his own family faces due to
involvement with drugs.
Lil Yachty croons, 

> I was juggin’ since a youngin’, free my older cousin Reesey.

Here, the word “juggin’” means dealing drugs on the streets. 
The first line establishes Lil Yachty himself as an authority on drug
dealing, giving him credence in offering advice on drug life. Immediately
after, he pleads to have his cousin freed from prison, which demonstrates the
fact that drug dealing has had a direct negative effect on his immediate
family. The juxtaposition of Lil Yachty’s own history with the placement of
his cousin in prison serves as cautionary advice for his listeners.

At the end of this verse, he admits that he 

> Almost had a lifetime sentence, but I beat it, shout out to Pat!   
> Pat, that’s my lawyer, he got me off them charges  
> Eight stacks for that boy. 

“Eight stacks” is equivalent to eight thousand dollars, which is no small
amount.

Lil Yachty offers a far more personal experience he has had with being
involved in crime, citing a “lifetime sentence” that he narrowly avoided. He
also includes the dollar cost of his brush with the law, which although is
insignificant compared to prison time, is not nothing.

Throughout *Minnesota* Lil Yachty appeals directly to his listeners.
In fact, he reprimands “you”, asking 

> why the f[\*\*] you in these streets if you scared of them four walls?

Lil Yachty makes this accusation personal, and pressures his listeners to
reconsider being in “these streets.”
The phrase “four walls” can refer to either the walls of a prison cell or the
walls of a tomb or coffin, both of which are presumably highly undesirable.

*Minnesota*, though upon first listen may seem substandard or insignificant, will
prove to be a major milestone in the history of trap’s development and
evolution.
