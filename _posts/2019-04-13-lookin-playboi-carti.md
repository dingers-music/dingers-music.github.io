Soundcloud rap is a label that, for better or worse, is slowly starting to fade
away. Used to describe a new wave of music exploding into mainstream rap in
2017, hallmarks of the genre included reiterative beats, ad-libs galore, and a
distinct unconcern with lyrical value.

Early espousers of the Soundcloud wave included SpaceGhostPurrp, Lil Pump, Lil
Yachty, Smokepurpp, and Lil Uzi Vert. Coming relatively late to the scene,
however, was Jordan Terrell Carter, better known as Playboi Carti. On April 14,
2017 Playboi Carti released his first commercial mixtape, appropriately titled
*Playboi Carti*. Well received by critics and fans alike, the album featured
hypnotic beats from producers such as Pi'erre Bourne and MexikoDro as well as
almost unintelligible delivery from Carti himself.

What distinguishes Carti from many of his peers in the “mumble rapper” category
is his extraordinary ability to innovate, and, indeed, redefine the limits of
Western popular musical form. Determining what era a Carti song is from is as
simple as listening to the track, as with every year, Carti continues to push
further and further into uncharted musical territory.

The sonic equivalent to the first picture of a black hole, *Lookin* wastes no
time in discussing the crux of the matter with its opening line (don’t worry if
you missed it the first time; it comprises perhaps half the song)

> Look at these n[\*\*]s.

Making clear his disdain for the gentlemen around him, Carti issues a cautionary
tale to choose one’s friends carefully to the backdrop of an oscillating,
reverbing synth. Carti’s lyrics, using fewer unique words than a Dr. Seuss novel,
complement the trance-inducing instrumental. In fact, *Lookin* blurs the line
between a Soundcloud classic and spiritual meditative music meant to elevate the
human condition.

Carti does not leave anything to the imagination when he describes his euphoric
state:

> I can’t even see, ooh  
> N[\*\*]s envy me, ooh  
> B[\*\*], I’m MVP, ooh

Perhaps referring to the transitory period in which one experiences ocular loss
when awakening a “third eye,” a sign of enlightenment, Carti proclaims his
heightened status to the listener, explaining why he can no longer associate
with most mortals.

Another noteworthy line comes from Carti’s longtime associated act, Lil Uzi
Vert. Mr. Vert immediately switches up the flow from Carti’s lulling delivery to
an infectious, emphatic spitting. Lyrically, he focuses his presentation on
several topics, including the fairer sex, firearms, and a fondness for bodily
ornamentation. One particularly clever line goes as:

> I'm a walking lick, woo, lick, lick, lick, lick  
> Told the girl I do not wanna fuck told her just lick, woo  
> Lick, lick, lick, ohh, ohh, ohh.  

In its first occurrence, “lick” is a colloquialism for an easy source of money,
particularly through robbing. However, he later uses the word to describe
non-committal oral sex, a clever mix up.  Surely there’s no more to be gleaned
from that verse, right? Wrong. Take a look again carefully; doesn’t something
seem off?

Yes, that’s right; there, in the first line: “I’m a walking lick.” Why would an
individual such as Mr. Vert exuberantly proclaim that he is an easy source of
money to anyone who would dare divest from him? Indeed, in both classic and
modern hip-hop, a common theme is an MC’s desire to protect his hard-earned
wealth and personal property. However, Mr. Vert subverts this capitalistic
expectation, and almost invites the genteel of the streets to “pull up” on him.
This further reinforces his persona as a hedonistic, gung-ho character, singular
in his pursuit to enjoy himself, misfortune be damned.

I could go on and on discussing this cornerstone of trap canon, but to be
completely honest, no amount of written exposition can do this song justice.
Words fail to capture the beauty and sublime found within Carti’s tour de force.
What, then, is a fan supposed to do to fully appreciate *Lookin*? That, dear
reader, is to *listen*.
